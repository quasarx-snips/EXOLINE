# EXOLINE — Month 1, Week 1: Foundation + polished UI shell

> COPY-PASTE THIS ENTIRE FILE INTO YOUR CODING AGENT.  
> This prompt is intentionally self-contained. Do not assume the agent has seen any other EXOLINE prompt.


You are a repository-aware coding agent working on EXOLINE, a browser-based space settlement and civilization expansion simulator. This prompt is SELF-CONTAINED. Do not require another EXOLINE prompt or external project brief to understand the task.

PROJECT NORTH STAR
The player starts on Earth in Sol, builds industry, designs rockets in a native SFS-style editor, launches missions, reaches orbit, transfers, lands/docks/floats/anchors according to body type, establishes bases, manages resources and population, automates missions with ASTRABLOCK, uses optional AI/ML assistance, expands across 60 named star systems, reaches Civilization Level 10, constructs and activates the Continuity Core, and then enters endless mode.

SOURCE-DEFINED FINAL SCALE
- 60 named star systems
- 480 named planets
- 120 named asteroids
- 80 rocket/infrastructure parts
- 14 resources
- 10 civilization levels
- 12 AI/ML modules
- 5 population cohorts
- 6 population skill groups
- ASTRABLOCK visual automation language
- four month-long development phases
The source design explicitly says AI systems are optional and deterministic fallbacks must exist. It also requires simulation level-of-detail, no per-citizen agents, no full N-body simulation for all systems, no simulation logic in the render loop, and no AI prediction blocking the main thread. fileciteturn0file0L58-L70 fileciteturn0file0L1111-L1121

ARCHITECTURE CONTRACT
Prefer this logical separation unless the existing repository already has an equivalent:
React + TypeScript UI
        ↓
typed commands / read models
        ↓
Web Worker
        ↓
Rust/WASM simulation core
        ↓
authoritative deterministic state

PixiJS handles spatial/visual rendering.
React handles panels, forms, dashboards, menus, inspectors, and application UI.
Rust/WASM or the established authoritative simulation layer owns game truth.
The render loop NEVER owns authoritative simulation.
UI NEVER directly mutates authoritative simulation state.
AI NEVER directly mutates authoritative simulation state.

If the repository already uses a reasonable equivalent architecture, preserve it instead of rewriting it.

AGENT WORK MODE
1. Inspect the repository first.
2. Reuse existing code.
3. Do not spend tokens writing a long plan.
4. Make reasonable implementation decisions without asking for confirmation unless implementation is genuinely impossible.
5. Implement first, then test, then fix.
6. Do not rewrite unrelated working modules.
7. Do not add duplicate state managers.
8. Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies.
9. Keep the app runnable.
10. Finish with a short report only.

UI-FIRST RULE
Every new feature must have a browser-visible UI representation in the same week.
Do not say “backend complete, UI later.”
Every important feature must define loading, ready, success, blocked/invalid, and error states where relevant.
Critical state must not be communicated only by color.
Important metrics need labels, units, and human-readable explanations.

DETERMINISM
Authoritative update:
state(t + Δt) = F(state(t), commands(t), seed)

Use fixed simulation steps.
Do not use render-frame duration as authoritative simulation time.
Use explicit seeded PRNG streams for generated/randomized gameplay.
Prefer deterministic iteration order.
Mission results, rewards, procedural generation, and economic calculations should be reproducible from state + commands + seed + version.

UNITS
Internal preferred units:
mass kg
distance m
time s
velocity m/s
acceleration m/s²
force N
power W
energy J
temperature K
pressure Pa
resource quantities = simulation units
rates = resource units/s or units/tick
Never mix units silently.

COMMON PHYSICS
g0 = 9.80665 m/s²

Tsiolkovsky:
Δv = Isp * g0 * ln(m0 / mf)

TWR:
TWR = T / (m * g)

Circular orbital velocity:
v_circular = sqrt(μ / r)

Orbital period:
T = 2π * sqrt(r³ / μ)

Hohmann transfer:
a_transfer = (r1 + r2) / 2
dv1 = sqrt(μ/r1) * (sqrt(2r2/(r1+r2)) - 1)
dv2 = sqrt(μ/r2) * (1 - sqrt(2r1/(r1+r2)))
dv_total = |dv1| + |dv2|
t_transfer = π * sqrt(a_transfer³ / μ)

Simplified vertical flight:
a = (T - D)/m - g
v_next = v + a*Δt
h_next = h + v*Δt

Simplified drag:
D = 0.5 * ρ * v² * Cd * A

Simple atmosphere:
ρ = ρ0 * exp(-h/H)

Simplified entry heating:
heatRate = k_heat * sqrt(max(ρ,0)) * v³
heat_next = heat + heatRate * Δt
temperature = baseTemperature + heat / heatCapacity

RESOURCE MODEL
For resource r:
next = clamp(
    current
    + production * Δt
    - consumption * Δt
    + inflow * Δt
    - outflow * Δt,
    0,
    capacity
)

netRate = production - consumption + inflow - outflow

If netRate < 0:
TTZ = current / abs(netRate)
Otherwise TTZ is not finite/displayed.

Storage:
accepted = min(requested, sourceAvailable, destinationFree)
overflow = requested - accepted

Never make resources negative.
Never exceed capacity.
Where the game specification says overflow production is lost, lost overflow must be explicit in telemetry/logs.

POPULATION
Use aggregate cohorts, never one agent per citizen.
Cohorts:
Children
Young Adults
Working Adults
Middle Adults
Elderly

Skills:
Unskilled
Technician
Engineer
Scientist
Administrator
Specialist

Population update:
nextPopulation = max(0, current + births - deaths + migrationIn - migrationOut)

Need satisfaction:
satisfaction = clamp(availableSupply / requiredDemand, 0, 1)

Effective labor:
labor = Σ cohortCount_i * workingFraction_i * skillAvailability_i * healthFactor

ROCKET COM/COТ
Center of mass:
r_COM = (Σ m_i r_i) / (Σ m_i)

Center of thrust:
r_COT = (Σ |F_i| r_i) / (Σ |F_i|)

TASK
Build the first real EXOLINE vertical slice.

THIS WEEK'S EXIT
A browser simulation runs a planetary economy with resources, storage, deterministic fixed-step simulation, time compression, visible UI, and save/load foundation.

IMPLEMENT
1. Inspect existing repository, package manager, framework, Rust/WASM, Worker, React, PixiJS, tests, persistence, and design system.
2. Preserve the existing working architecture.
3. Create or finish the simulation Worker boundary.
4. Create deterministic fixed-step tick.
5. Create GameState with:
schemaVersion
contentVersion
simulationTimeSeconds
simulationSpeed
universeSeed
currentSystemId
currentBodyId
civilizationLevel
resources
storage
productionRates
consumptionRates
notifications
6. Register exactly 14 resources:
Metals, Water, Food, Oxygen, Fuel, Rare Minerals, Organics, Silicates, Volatiles, Nuclear Fuel, Components, Science Data, Reward Tokens, Blueprint Tokens.
7. Make Earth/Sol the start:
Sol → Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
Sol asteroids → Ceres, Vesta.
8. Give Earth non-zero starter resources, finite storage, production, consumption, civilization level 0.
9. Keep starter values in configuration/content.
10. Add time speeds:
1x, 10x, 100x, 1000x
Pause must stop authoritative simulation.
11. Add resource accounting using the resource equations in this prompt.
12. Add storage capacity and overflow logic.
13. Build a serious application shell:
top bar, navigation, location, simulation clock, speed controls, civilization level, resource summary, alert area, main view, inspector, event log.
14. Add reusable UI components:
Panel, StatCard, ResourceRow, ProgressBar, StatusBadge, Tab, Button, Tooltip, Alert, EventLog.
15. Add screens/tabs:
Overview, System, Economy, Storage, Settings/Save.
16. Add local save/load abstraction; use IndexedDB if already configured or implement a clean storage adapter ready for IndexedDB.
17. Save schemaVersion, contentVersion, simulation time, universe seed, and authoritative state.
18. Add Worker command/event types.
19. Do not update every React component on every simulation sub-step if a projection/throttling layer avoids that.
20. Add tests.

TESTS
- deterministic resource tick
- zero clamp
- storage capacity/overflow
- time compression
- Worker command path
- save/load round trip
- stable Earth identity

DEMO
Open app → see Earth → start simulation → change speed → see resources change → pause → inspect storage → save → reload → load → verify same state.

DO NOT
- build rocket flight
- build ML models
- build a huge visual planet renderer
- add cloud/backend dependency
