# EXOLINE — Month 2, Week 5: Rocket parts + native rocket editor

> COPY-PASTE THIS ENTIRE FILE INTO YOUR CODING AGENT.  
> This prompt is intentionally self-contained. Do not assume the agent has seen any other EXOLINE prompt.


You are a repository-aware coding agent working on EXOLINE, a browser-based space settlement and civilization expansion simulator. This prompt is SELF-CONTAINED. Do not require another EXOLINE prompt or external project brief to understand the task.

PROJECT NORTH STAR
The player starts on Earth in Sol, builds industry, designs rockets in a native SFS-style editor, launches missions, reaches orbit, transfers, lands/docks/floats/anchors according to body type, establishes bases, manages resources and population, automates missions with ASTRABLOCK, uses optional AI/ML assistance, expands across 60 named star systems, reaches Civilization Level 10, constructs and activates the Continuity Core, and then enters endless mode.

SOURCE-DEFINED FINAL SCALE
- 60 named star systems
- 480 named planets
- 120 named asteroids
- 80 rocket/infrastructure parts
- 14 resources
- 10 civilization levels
- 12 AI/ML modules
- 5 population cohorts
- 6 population skill groups
- ASTRABLOCK visual automation language
- four month-long development phases
The source design explicitly says AI systems are optional and deterministic fallbacks must exist. It also requires simulation level-of-detail, no per-citizen agents, no full N-body simulation for all systems, no simulation logic in the render loop, and no AI prediction blocking the main thread. fileciteturn0file0L58-L70 fileciteturn0file0L1111-L1121

ARCHITECTURE CONTRACT
Prefer this logical separation unless the existing repository already has an equivalent:
React + TypeScript UI
        ↓
typed commands / read models
        ↓
Web Worker
        ↓
Rust/WASM simulation core
        ↓
authoritative deterministic state

PixiJS handles spatial/visual rendering.
React handles panels, forms, dashboards, menus, inspectors, and application UI.
Rust/WASM or the established authoritative simulation layer owns game truth.
The render loop NEVER owns authoritative simulation.
UI NEVER directly mutates authoritative simulation state.
AI NEVER directly mutates authoritative simulation state.

If the repository already uses a reasonable equivalent architecture, preserve it instead of rewriting it.

AGENT WORK MODE
1. Inspect the repository first.
2. Reuse existing code.
3. Do not spend tokens writing a long plan.
4. Make reasonable implementation decisions without asking for confirmation unless implementation is genuinely impossible.
5. Implement first, then test, then fix.
6. Do not rewrite unrelated working modules.
7. Do not add duplicate state managers.
8. Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies.
9. Keep the app runnable.
10. Finish with a short report only.

UI-FIRST RULE
Every new feature must have a browser-visible UI representation in the same week.
Do not say “backend complete, UI later.”
Every important feature must define loading, ready, success, blocked/invalid, and error states where relevant.
Critical state must not be communicated only by color.
Important metrics need labels, units, and human-readable explanations.

DETERMINISM
Authoritative update:
state(t + Δt) = F(state(t), commands(t), seed)

Use fixed simulation steps.
Do not use render-frame duration as authoritative simulation time.
Use explicit seeded PRNG streams for generated/randomized gameplay.
Prefer deterministic iteration order.
Mission results, rewards, procedural generation, and economic calculations should be reproducible from state + commands + seed + version.

UNITS
Internal preferred units:
mass kg
distance m
time s
velocity m/s
acceleration m/s²
force N
power W
energy J
temperature K
pressure Pa
resource quantities = simulation units
rates = resource units/s or units/tick
Never mix units silently.

COMMON PHYSICS
g0 = 9.80665 m/s²

Tsiolkovsky:
Δv = Isp * g0 * ln(m0 / mf)

TWR:
TWR = T / (m * g)

Circular orbital velocity:
v_circular = sqrt(μ / r)

Orbital period:
T = 2π * sqrt(r³ / μ)

Hohmann transfer:
a_transfer = (r1 + r2) / 2
dv1 = sqrt(μ/r1) * (sqrt(2r2/(r1+r2)) - 1)
dv2 = sqrt(μ/r2) * (1 - sqrt(2r1/(r1+r2)))
dv_total = |dv1| + |dv2|
t_transfer = π * sqrt(a_transfer³ / μ)

Simplified vertical flight:
a = (T - D)/m - g
v_next = v + a*Δt
h_next = h + v*Δt

Simplified drag:
D = 0.5 * ρ * v² * Cd * A

Simple atmosphere:
ρ = ρ0 * exp(-h/H)

Simplified entry heating:
heatRate = k_heat * sqrt(max(ρ,0)) * v³
heat_next = heat + heatRate * Δt
temperature = baseTemperature + heat / heatCapacity

RESOURCE MODEL
For resource r:
next = clamp(
    current
    + production * Δt
    - consumption * Δt
    + inflow * Δt
    - outflow * Δt,
    0,
    capacity
)

netRate = production - consumption + inflow - outflow

If netRate < 0:
TTZ = current / abs(netRate)
Otherwise TTZ is not finite/displayed.

Storage:
accepted = min(requested, sourceAvailable, destinationFree)
overflow = requested - accepted

Never make resources negative.
Never exceed capacity.
Where the game specification says overflow production is lost, lost overflow must be explicit in telemetry/logs.

POPULATION
Use aggregate cohorts, never one agent per citizen.
Cohorts:
Children
Young Adults
Working Adults
Middle Adults
Elderly

Skills:
Unskilled
Technician
Engineer
Scientist
Administrator
Specialist

Population update:
nextPopulation = max(0, current + births - deaths + migrationIn - migrationOut)

Need satisfaction:
satisfaction = clamp(availableSupply / requiredDemand, 0, 1)

Effective labor:
labor = Σ cohortCount_i * workingFraction_i * skillAvailability_i * healthFactor

ROCKET COM/COТ
Center of mass:
r_COM = (Σ m_i r_i) / (Σ m_i)

Center of thrust:
r_COT = (Σ |F_i| r_i) / (Σ |F_i|)

TASK
Start Month 2 by building a real native SFS-style rocket editor.

EXIT
Browser UI can browse 80 parts, add/remove/move/attach/detach/rotate/stage parts, calculate mass/cost/COM/COT, and save/load blueprints.

ROCKET DATA
PartDefinition is static content.
RocketPartInstance references definitionId.

RocketPartInstance:
instanceId
definitionId
parentInstanceId
attachmentNode
localTransform
rotation
stageIndex
enabled
customState

GRAPH
Rocket = rooted directed graph.
Validate:
exactly one root
root has valid command/control capability
no cycles
all parts connected
attachments compatible
stages reference real parts

COM:
r_COM = Σ(m_i*r_i)/Σm_i

COT:
r_COT = Σ(|F_i|r_i)/Σ|F_i|

MASS
m_total = Σ partDryMass + Σ propellantMass + payloadMass

DELTA-V
For valid stage:
Δv_stage = Isp*g0*ln(m_wet/m_dry_after_burn)
Δv_total = sum(valid stages)

TWR
TWR = T/(m*g)

EDITOR
left: searchable parts
center: build canvas
right: inspector
bottom/top: diagnostics + vehicle stats

Stats always visible:
Mass
Dry Mass
Propellant
Delta-v
TWR
Cost
Part count

Interactions:
drag/add
select
move
rotate
delete
attach
detach
assign stage

VALIDATION
Structured:
severity
code
message
partIds
stageIds
suggestion

Examples:
missing command root
disconnected part
cycle
stage without engine
invalid attachment
missing landing system for target environment

BLUEPRINT
schemaVersion
blueprintId
name
parts
stage definitions
automationProgramId nullable
metadata

Operations:
create
save
load
duplicate
delete

UI must make validation reasons obvious.

TESTS
graph connectivity
cycle detection
single root
COM
COT
mass
cost
delta-v
TWR
blueprint round trip
duplicate independence

DEMO
Build rocket → move/rotate → stage → stats → save → reload → duplicate → modify duplicate → original unchanged.

DO NOT
- implement full orbital flight yet
- create separate physics engines
